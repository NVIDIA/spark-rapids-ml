Spark Rapids ML enables GPU accelerated distributed machine learning on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).  It provides several PySpark ML compatible algorithms powered by the [RAPIDS cuML](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/) library, along with a compatible Scala API for the PCA algorithm.

See [API Docs](api).
